# @psytech/template-engine

[`@psytech/react-render-engine`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@psytech/react-render-engine) package converts structured layout data called as **"templates"** into user interfaces. The above-mentioned package solves a part of the problem related to rendering of templates which may have some default text values & image sources.

This package is to be used for importing & validating, templates & source map data, which can be used to templatise data received from any source (e.g. CSV, JSON) that can be rendered using @psytech/react-render-engine package

Here's a simple demonstration of this, which templatises RSS feed into a selected template: https://r2c.psytech42.repl.co/
